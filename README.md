# Emotion Recognition

I have combined 4 emotion recognition dataset. 

 - CREMA - D (Crowd Sourced Emotional Multimodal Actors Dataset)
- RAVDESS Emotional speech audio
- Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (SAVEE)
- Toronto emotional speech set (TESS)

From these datasets we have classified emotions in total 14 categories. Which includes, For Male and Female: 
Sad, Happy, Surprise, Neutral, Angry, Disgust and Fear. 

By applying model, I have achieved nearly 54% total accuracy (For all 14 categories)

For classification of Male and Female datasets, nearly 80% accuracy is achieved. 

For classification of emotions nearly 57% of accuracy is achieved.
